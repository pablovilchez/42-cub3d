Cub3D is a fascinating project inspired by the world's first-ever first-person shooter, Wolfenstein 3D, which was a significant pioneer of the genre in the early 1990s. This project aims to recreate the technique of ray-casting used in the original game, albeit in a more modern and simplified context.

The Cub3D project is not just about creating a game, but it's about appreciating the history of computer graphics and understanding the underlying techniques that make our favorite video games possible.

## 🤨 Ray-casting ?
Ray-casting is a rendering technique used in 3D graphics to create a 3D perspective in a 2D map. Back in the day when the computers were not powerful enough to handle full 3D, ray-casting was a neat trick to simulate a 3D view with less computational cost.

## 🏚 Usage
Before running the program, ensure you have the necessary libraries installed, depending on your operating system.

### macOS

```bash
brew update
brew install glfw
```

If you are a student of 42 Málaga and encounter the error "command not found: brew" run the following command to install Homebrew:
```bash
curl -fsSL https://rawgit.com/kube/42homebrew/master/install.sh | zsh
```

### Linux

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install build-essential libx11-dev libglfw3-dev libglfw3 xorg-dev
```

Once the libraries are installed, you can build and run the program using the following commands:

```
make
```

## 🙏 **Appreciation Corner**
   This remarkable project was accomplished and refined to its finest form through the assistance of my comrade and collaborator, the virtuoso [🧮 pvilchez](https://github.com/pablovilchez).
